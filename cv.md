is to learn how to program in JavaScript and start working in

easy programming language. I am fast learner and hardworking 
because I live by it :). I haven't experience in professional programming, 
but i do everything to learn and start working;

```using System;

        if (str.Contains('_')) words = str.Split('_');
        char firstLetter = str[0];
        string temporaryString;
        str = "";
        if (Char.IsUpper(firstLetter))
            foreach(var e in words)
                str += e;
        else
            for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
            {
                temporaryString = words[i];
                if (i > 0)
                    temporaryString = temporaryString[0].ToString().ToUpper() + temporaryString.Substring(1);
